## 🚀 Vision

**LastParadox** is a **decentralized VPN (dVPN)** that empowers users to reclaim internet sovereignty through privacy, anonymity, and peer-to-peer networking.  
Our mission: **return control of the internet to its users** — no central servers, no intermediaries, no compromise.

## 🔑 Features

- 🧅 **Tor-based Architecture** – every connection runs through private `.onion` circuits for complete anonymity.  
- 🌐 **Distributed Hash Table (DHT)** – decentralized peer discovery, no central API or server.  
- 🔐 **Zero-Knowledge Authentication** – private access via zk-SNARKs powered by [zk.lastparadox.xyz](https://zk.lastparadox.xyz).  
- 💰 **Rewards System** – earn **$LPRX** for hosting stable, verified Tor nodes.  
- 🧩 **Blockchain Integration (Solana)** – wallet-based identity, governance, and staking.  
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform Access** – desktop app (Tauri), dashboard (Vercel), and real-time node monitoring.
