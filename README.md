🚀 Vision

LastParadox is evolving into a fully decentralized Privacy Network DAO, giving users complete sovereignty over their identity, privacy, and connection.

Our mission:

build a community-owned, censorship-resistant internet layer

— no central servers, no data collection, no intermediaries.

The network runs on Tor, HyperNodes, HyperBee and Zero-Knowledge authentication.

🔑 Features

🧅 Tor-Integrated Architecture – all connections routed through private .onion circuits for anonymity and obfuscation.

🌐 HyperNodes (DHT replaced) – decentralized peer routing using the Hyper stack (secure, fast, self-replicating).

🗄️ HyperBee Storage – distributed metadata (nodes, claims, protocol state) with no central database.

🔐 Zero-Knowledge Authentication – identity-less login via zk-SNARKs powered by zk.lastparadox.xyz
.

💰 RWRD Rewards – earn RWRD tokens for hosting nodes, uptime, and contributing to the DAO.

🛡️ Premium TUN Mode – full kernel VPN mode routing all OS traffic through Tor.

🧩 DAO Governance – community voting, treasury management, protocol upgrades, and improvement proposals.

🖥️ Cross-platform Stack – desktop (Tauri), HyperNode daemon, static landing page, and admin tools.

Key components

🖥 App-Tauri: client interface (Host/Client), TUN toggle, ZK login, rewards panel

⚙️ LP-Daemon: Tor engine, HyperNode routing, HyperBee syncing, local services

🌍 LandingLast: static website + live network status (via HyperBee)
