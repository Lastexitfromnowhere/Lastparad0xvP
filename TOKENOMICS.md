## 0. Current Status — Phase 0 (Ongoing)

LastParadox is in **Phase 0**, the contributor-driven bootstrap phase.

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ | No token exists |
| ✅ | No NFT sale |
| ✅ | No financial offering |
| ✅ | No presale or private sale |
| ✅ | Network powered by community contributions |
| 🔄 | DAO governance structure in development |
| 🔄 | Legal and fiscal framework being established |

### What Phase 0 Means

During this phase, the project focuses exclusively on:

- Building functional, production-ready software
- Establishing network infrastructure (Tor relays, HyperNodes)
- Developing governance mechanisms
- Growing an engaged contributor community
- Ensuring legal and regulatory compliance

**The token (RWRD) will only be created when:**
1. The application is stable and feature-complete
2. The TUN kernel mode is finalized and audited
3. The DAO treasury has sufficient resources
4. The community votes to proceed with tokenization
5. Legal review confirms compliance in target jurisdictions

## 2. Proposed Token Overview (Phase 1 — Requires DAO Vote)

The following describes a **proposed** token model. Implementation requires:
- Successful completion of Phase 0 milestones
- Formal DAO governance vote with supermajority approval
- Legal review and compliance verification
- Technical audit of token contracts

### Proposed Specifications

| Attribute | Proposed Value | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Name | LastParadox Reward Token | Draft |
| Ticker | $RWRD | Draft |
| Blockchain | Solana (SPL) | Under Review |
| Total Supply | 1,000,000,000 | Subject to DAO Vote |
| Inflation | None (fixed supply) | Subject to DAO Vote |
| Burn Mechanism | DAO-controlled (optional) | Under Discussion |

### Proposed Utility (If Token Created)

| Utility | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Premium Access | Payment for TUN mode and advanced features | Proposed |
| Uptime Rewards | Incentives for HyperNode operators | Proposed |
| Governance Voting | Weighted voting in DAO proposals | Proposed |
| Anti-Sybil Staking | Quality-of-service weighting | Under Discussion |
| Infrastructure Incentives | Rewards for Tor relay operators | Under Discussion |

---

## 3. Proposed Distribution (Requires DAO Approval)

The following allocation is a **working proposal** subject to change.

| Category | Proposed % | Proposed Amount | Notes | Status |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Community Rewards | 50% | 500,000,000 | HyperNode uptime, Tor routing, contributions | Proposed |
| Node Incentives | 15% | 150,000,000 | Bootstrap for relays and HyperBee network | Proposed |
| Core Team | 8% | 80,000,000 | 12-month cliff + 36-month vesting | Proposed |
| Early Contributors | 4% | 40,000,000 | Phase 0 supporters, DAO-defined criteria | Proposed |
| Liquidity Provision | 5% | 50,000,000 | DEX liquidity (DAO vote required) | Under Review |
| Ecosystem Development | 8% | 80,000,000 | SDKs, mobile app, TUN R&D, audits | Proposed |
| DAO Treasury | 5% | 50,000,000 | Grants, partnerships, contingency | Proposed |
| Marketing & Growth | 5% | 50,000,000 | Ecosystem expansion, partnerships | Proposed |

### Vesting Schedules (Proposed)

| Category | Cliff | Vesting Period | Release Schedule |
|----------|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Core Team | 12 months | 36 months | Linear monthly |
| Early Contributors | 6 months | 24 months | Linear monthly |
| Node Incentives | None | 60-84 months | Performance-based |
| Community Rewards | None | 60-84 months | Activity-based |

### Important Notes on Distribution

- **No allocation is final** until DAO vote
- **Early Contributors** category is separate from Core Team
- **Criteria for eligibility** will be defined by DAO governance
- **Contribution amount does not guarantee proportional allocation**
- **DAO may modify percentages** before token creation

## 4. Why No Token Yet — Risk Mitigation

Launching a token prematurely introduces significant risks:

### Regulatory Risks
- Securities classification uncertainty
- Jurisdictional compliance complexity
- Potential enforcement actions
- KYC/AML requirements

### Market Risks
- Low liquidity leading to manipulation
- Extreme volatility harming users
- Speculation overshadowing utility
- "Pump and dump" vulnerability

### Project Risks
- Misaligned incentives (trading > building)
- Community fragmentation
- Resource diversion to token management
- "Token-first, product-later" failure pattern

### Our Approach: Build First

```
Phase 0 (NOW)     → Contributors fund → Network grows → App matures
Phase 1 (FUTURE)  → DAO votes → Token created → Distribution begins
Phase 2 (LATER)   → Full decentralization → Community governance
```

This approach ensures:
- Product-market fit before tokenization
- Genuine community of users, not speculators
- Regulatory clarity before token creation
- Sustainable economics based on real utility

---

## 5. Governance Framework (In Development)

### Current State (Phase 0)
- Off-chain governance via Discord and GitHub
- Core team multisig for treasury
- Community input on major decisions
- Transparent development process

### Planned State (Phase 1+)
- On-chain governance (after audit)
- Token-weighted voting (if RWRD created)
- Proposal and voting mechanisms
- Treasury management by DAO

### Governance Scope

The DAO will have authority over:
- Protocol upgrades and parameters
- Reward formulas and distribution
- Treasury allocation and grants
- Partnership and integration decisions
- Token creation and tokenomics (if applicable)

---

## 6. Security & Compliance Commitments

### What We Commit To

| Commitment | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| No token sale | Contributions are for services only |
| No securities offering | No profit-sharing or dividends |
| Transparent treasury | Multisig with public addresses |
| Regular updates | Monthly status reports |
| Community governance | All major decisions voted |
| Legal compliance | Ongoing legal review |

### Technical Security

- ZK identity for anti-Sybil protection
- HyperBee for decentralized data (no central DB)
- Tor for anonymized routing
- Open-source code for auditability
- Third-party audits before critical releases

---

## 7. Roadmap Integration

| Phase | Focus | Token Status |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Phase 0** (Current) | Build, test, grow community | No token |
| **Phase 0.5** | DAO structure, legal framework | No token |
| **Phase 1** | Stability, audits, DAO vote | Token decision |
| **Phase 2** | If approved: mint, distribute | Token active |
| **Phase 3** | Full decentralization | DAO-governed |

### Phase 0 Milestones (In Progress)

- [x] ZK authentication
- [ ] TUN mode stabilization
- [ ] Multi-platform parity (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- [ ] Security audit completion
- [ ] DAO governance framework

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

### "When will the token launch?"

There is no set date. Token creation requires:
1. Completion of Phase 0 milestones
2. DAO governance vote with supermajority
3. Legal compliance verification
4. Community consensus

### "Am I guaranteed tokens if I contribute?"

**No.** Contributions provide service access and governance rights. Future token eligibility is:
- Not guaranteed
- Subject to DAO vote
- Based on criteria not yet defined
- Potentially different from contribution amounts

### "Is this an investment?"

**No.** Contributions are payments for services (VPN access, governance participation). They are not:
- Investment contracts
- Securities
- Profit-sharing agreements
- Token presales

### "What if the token never launches?"

Contributors still receive:
- Functional VPN software
- Governance participation rights
- Community membership
- The value they paid for in services

### "Can I get a refund?"

Contributions are for services rendered. Refund policies follow standard software subscription terms, not investment redemption logic.

## 10. Conclusion

RWRD is **not** the starting point — **contributors and users are**.

Today, contributors receive:
- ✅ Functional privacy software
- ✅ Governance participation rights
- ✅ Community membership and recognition
- ✅ The services they paid for

Tomorrow, **if the DAO decides**, there may be:
- 🔄 A token creation vote
- 🔄 Distribution mechanisms
- 🔄 Additional utility features

**The focus remains on building useful software, not launching tokens.**

**Privacy first. Users first. Product first.**

*Token later — maybe — if the community decides.*
