## 0. Current Status — Phase 0 (Ongoing)

LastParadox is in **Phase 0**, the contributor-driven bootstrap phase.

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ✅ | No token exists |
| ✅ | No NFT sale |
| ✅ | No financial offering |
| ✅ | No presale or private sale |

### What Phase 0 Means

During this phase, the project focuses exclusively on:

- Building functional, production-ready software
- Establishing network infrastructure (Tor relays, HyperNodes)
- Developing governance mechanisms

**The token (RWRD) will only be created when:**
1. The application is stable and feature-complete
2. The TUN kernel mode is finalized and audited

## 2. Proposed Token Overview (Phase 1 — Requires DAO Vote)

The following describes a **proposed** token model. Implementation requires:
- Successful completion of Phase 0 milestones
- Formal DAO governance vote with supermajority approval
- Legal review and compliance verification
- Technical audit of token contracts

### Proposed Specifications

| Attribute | Proposed Value | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Name | LastParadox Reward Token | Draft |
| Ticker | $RWRD | Draft |
| Blockchain | Solana (SPL) | Under Review |
| Total Supply | 1,000,000,000 | Subject to DAO Vote |
| Inflation | None (fixed supply) | Subject to DAO Vote |
| Burn Mechanism | DAO-controlled (optional) | Under Discussion |

### 🛠️ Role of Active Users ("Killstreak Rewards")

In the V2 architecture, daily engagement is rewarded via a **Killstreak** system.

*   **Who earns?** Any activated user who meets the uptime requirement (60 minutes/day).
*   **How it works:** Users claim daily rewards via the in-app claim button. Consecutive daily claims build a streak (1–7+ days) with progressively increasing rewards.
*   **Why it matters:** Active participation strengthens the network. Future RWRD tokens would be distributed based on cumulative claim history.

### Proposed Utility (If Token Created)

| Utility | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Premium Access | Payment for TUN mode and advanced features | Proposed |
| Proof-of-Uptime | Incentives for daily active users (Killstreak) | Proposed |
| Governance Voting | Weighted voting in DAO proposals | Proposed |
| Anti-Sybil Staking | Ticket-based verification | Under Discussion |
| Infrastructure Incentives | Rewards for Tor relay operators | Under Discussion |

---

## 3. Proposed Distribution (Requires DAO Approval)

The following allocation is a **working proposal** subject to change.

| Category | Proposed % | Proposed Amount | Notes | Status |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Network Rewards | 50% | 500,000,000 | Daily killstreak rewards, activity-based | Proposed |
| Node Incentives | 15% | 150,000,000 | Bootstrap for HyperNode relay operators | Proposed |
| Core Team | 8% | 80,000,000 | 12-month cliff + 36-month vesting | Proposed |
| Early Contributors | 4% | 40,000,000 | Phase 0 supporters, DAO-defined criteria | Proposed |
| Liquidity Provision | 5% | 50,000,000 | DEX liquidity (DAO vote required) | Under Review |
| Ecosystem Development | 8% | 80,000,000 | SDKs, mobile app, TUN R&D, audits | Proposed |
| DAO Treasury | 5% | 50,000,000 | Grants, partnerships, contingency | Proposed |
| Marketing & Growth | 5% | 50,000,000 | Ecosystem expansion, partnerships | Proposed |

### Vesting Schedules (Proposed)

| Category | Cliff | Vesting Period | Release Schedule |
|----------|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Core Team | 12 months | 36 months | Linear monthly |
| Early Contributors | 6 months | 24 months | Linear monthly |
| Node Incentives | None | 60-84 months | Performance-based |
| Community Rewards | None | 60-84 months | Activity-based |

### Important Notes on Distribution

- **No allocation is final** until DAO vote
- **Early Contributors** category is separate from Core Team
- **Criteria for eligibility** will be defined by DAO governance
- **Contribution amount does not guarantee proportional allocation**
- **DAO may modify percentages** before token creation

## 4. Why No Token Yet — Risk Mitigation

Launching a token prematurely introduces significant risks:

### Regulatory Risks
- Securities classification uncertainty
- Jurisdictional compliance complexity
- Potential enforcement actions
- KYC/AML requirements

### Market Risks
- Low liquidity leading to manipulation
- Extreme volatility harming users
- Speculation overshadowing utility
- "Pump and dump" vulnerability

### Project Risks
- Misaligned incentives (trading > building)
- Community fragmentation
- Resource diversion to token management
- "Token-first, product-later" failure pattern

### Our Approach: Build First

```
Phase 0 (NOW)     → Contributors fund → Network grows → App matures
Phase 1 (FUTURE)  → DAO votes → Token created → Distribution begins
Phase 2 (LATER)   → Full decentralization → Community governance
```

This approach ensures:
- Product-market fit before tokenization
- Genuine community of users, not speculators
- Regulatory clarity before token creation
- Sustainable economics based on real utility

---

## 5. Governance Framework (In Development)

### Current State (Phase 0)
- Off-chain governance via Discord and GitHub
- Core team multisig for treasury
- Community input on major decisions
- Transparent development process

### Planned State (Phase 1+)
- On-chain governance (after audit)
- Token-weighted voting (if RWRD created)
- Proposal and voting mechanisms
- Treasury management by DAO

### Governance Scope

The DAO will have authority over:
- Protocol upgrades and parameters
- Reward formulas and distribution
- Treasury allocation and grants
- Partnership and integration decisions
- Token creation and tokenomics (if applicable)

---

## 6. Security & Compliance Commitments

### What We Commit To

| Commitment | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| No token sale | Contributions are for services only |
| No securities offering | No profit-sharing or dividends |
| Transparent treasury | Multisig with public addresses |
| Regular updates | Monthly status reports |
| Community governance | All major decisions voted |
| Legal compliance | Ongoing legal review |

### Technical Security

- Ed25519 signed tickets for anti-Sybil protection
- HyperBee for decentralized data (no central DB)
- Tor for anonymized routing
- Open-source code for auditability
- Third-party audits before critical releases

---

## 7. Roadmap Integration

| Phase | Focus | Token Status |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Phase 0** (Current) | Build, test, grow community | No token |
| **Phase 0.5** | DAO structure, legal framework | No token |

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

### "When will the token launch?"

There is no set date. Token creation requires:
1. Completion of Phase 0 milestones
2. DAO governance vote with supermajority
3. Legal compliance verification
4. Community consensus

### "Am I guaranteed tokens if I contribute?"

**No.** Contributions provide service access and governance rights. Future token eligibility is:
- Not guaranteed
- Subject to DAO vote
- Based on criteria not yet defined
- Potentially different from contribution amounts

### "Is this an investment?"

**No.** Contributions are payments for services (VPN access, governance participation). They are not:
- Investment contracts
- Securities
- Profit-sharing agreements
- Token presales

### "What if the token never launches?"

Contributors still receive:
- Functional VPN software
- Governance participation rights
- Community membership
- The value they paid for in services

### "Can I get a refund?"

Contributions are for services rendered. Refund policies follow standard software subscription terms, not investment redemption logic.

## 10. Conclusion

RWRD is **not** the starting point — **contributors and users are**.

Today, contributors receive:
- ✅ Functional privacy software
- ✅ Governance participation rights
- ✅ Community membership and recognition
- ✅ The services they paid for

Tomorrow, **if the DAO decides**, there may be:
- 🔄 A token creation vote
- 🔄 Distribution mechanisms
- 🔄 Additional utility features

**The focus remains on building useful software, not launching tokens.**

**Privacy first. Users first. Product first.**

*Token later — maybe — if the community decides.*
