4. **Users pay VPN** → fees in $RWRD  
5. **Protocol distributes rewards** → node operators & stakers  
6. **DAO treasury collects fees** → dev, audits, marketing

- DAO manages:  
  - Reward emissions  
  - Treasury spending  
  - Protocol & economic upgrades  

---

## 8. Security & Compliance

- Team tokens locked → 12m cliff + 36m vesting  
- Minimal initial liquidity → gradual strengthening lowers volatility  
- Smart contracts → audited before launch
