# 💠 LastParadox Tokenomics (RWRD)

LastParadox is transitioning into a **fully decentralized DAO**.  
At this stage, the network is in **Phase 0**, meaning:

✅ No token yet  
✅ No NFT sale  
✅ No financial offering  
✅ Everything is built through **community contributions**  

Once the network is stable, the app is complete, the TUN kernel is finalized,  
and the DAO treasury is healthy, the community will collectively mint the **RWRD token**.

---

# ✅ 0. Phase 0 — Contributor-Driven Launch

The network is currently powered by **contributors**.  
Before the token exists, contributors help fund and bootstrap:

- Tor relays, bridges, circuits  
- HyperNodes + HyperBee network  
- TUN kernel mode & OS integration  
- ZK authentication (local proofs + HyperBee identities)  
- App updates, daemon improvements, multi-OS support  
- VPS + infrastructure  
- DAO governance tools  
- Legal and fiscal structure  

### ✅ Contribution tiers (service access, not tokens)

#### **🔹 Member — $4/year**
- Basic browser proxy access  
- Supports infrastructure  
- Receives features matching the tier  

#### **🔹 Governance — $9/year**
- Full app access  
- Voting rights (1 year)  
- Eligibility for future reward cycles  

#### **🔹 Investor Tier — from $50**
- Supports long-term R&D (Hyper, Tor, TUN, ZK)  
- Early feature access  
- Priority governance role  
- Eligibility for future DAO-approved RWRD distributions  

⚠️ These contributions are **not investments** and **not token purchases**.

---

# ✅ Compensation for Contributors (DePIN Logic)

Contributors receive **real, tangible value** while the network is being built.

### ✅ 1. A functional application  
Each tier unlocks features matching their contribution level:
- Proxy  
- Full client  
- TUN mode  
- Future expansions  

### ✅ 2. Governance power  
Contributors shape:
- Reward parameters  
- Treasury usage  
- Protocol upgrades  
- HyperNode incentives  
- DAO structure  
- App evolution  

### ✅ 3. Eligibility for future rewards (RWRD)  
When RWRD launches (Phase 1), contributors will have:
- Priority eligibility for reward cycles  
- DAO-defined vesting distributions  
- DePIN-style “early supporter advantage”  

### ✅ 4. Recognition inside the DAO  
Contributors are considered:
- Early Builders  
- Network Bootstrap Providers  
- Protocol Stewards  
- Governance Pioneers  

---

# ✅ 1. Token Overview (Phase 1 — DAO Vote Required)

Once the DAO decides to create the token:

- **Name:** LastParadox Reward Token  
- **Ticker:** $RWRD  
- **Blockchain:** Solana (SPL)  
- **Supply:** 1,000,000,000 (fixed, no inflation)  
- **Purpose:** Rewards, governance, access, anti-Sybil  

RWRD will **not** be sold.  
It will be **distributed for participation**, uptime, and contribution.

---

# ✅ 2. Planned Distribution (post-launch)

| Category                | % | Allocation | Notes |
|-------------------------|----|-----------|-------|
| Community Rewards       | 50% | 500,000,000 | HyperNode uptime, Tor routing, app contributions |
| Node Incentives         | 15% | 150,000,000 | Bootstrap for relays, hosts, HyperBee network |
| Team & Contributors     | 12% | 120,000,000 | 12-month cliff + 36-month vesting |
| Liquidity Provision     | 8%  | 80,000,000  | Raydium LP (DAO vote required) |
| Marketing & Partners    | 5%  | 50,000,000  | Ecosystem growth |
| DAO Treasury            | 5%  | 50,000,000  | Grants, audits, contributions |
| Ecosystem Development   | 5%  | 50,000,000  | SDKs, mobile app, TUN R&D |

⚠️ This distribution activates **only after token creation and DAO approval**.

---

# ✅ 3. Why RWRD Is Not Launched Yet

Launching a token too early introduces:

- ⚠️ **Regulatory exposure**  
- ⚠️ **Wrong incentives** (token speculation > network building)  
- ⚠️ **Low liquidity & massive volatility**  
- ⚠️ **Risk of “token-first, product-later” failure**,  
  the most common crash pattern in Web3  

LastParadox avoids this by following a **sustainable model**:

### ✅ Phase 0 (NOW): Build  
Contributors fund → Network grows → App evolves → TUN stabilizes → DAO forms

### ✅ Phase 1: Token Mint  
DAO creates RWRD → Distribution activates → Rewards begin

### ✅ Phase 2: Full Decentralization  
Treasury-managed by community → Proposals → Node incentives → Sustainability

---

# ✅ 4. Utility (once RWRD exists)

- 💸 **Premium TUN payments**  
- 🏆 **Uptime rewards**  
- 🔐 **Anti-Sybil staking**  
- 🧠 **ZK identity binding**  
- 🗳 **DAO voting**  
- 💻 **Infrastructure incentives (Tor + HyperNodes)**  

---

# ✅ 5. Emission Schedule (post-launch)

No inflation. Entire supply minted once.

| Category | Duration | Mechanism |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Community Rewards | 5–7 years | Linear |
| Node Incentives | DAO-controlled | Dynamic |
| Team | 48 months | Cliff + vesting |
| Treasury | Ongoing | Governance |

---

# ✅ 6. Token Flow (post-launch)

1. DAO creates RWRD  
2. LP seeded on Raydium (small initial pool)  
3. Node rewards activate  
4. Premium features use RWRD  
5. Treasury collects revenue  
6. DAO decides reinvestments  

---

# ✅ 7. Security & Compliance

- No token sale  
- No NFT mint  
- No dividends  
- No financial promises  
- DAO multisig treasury  
- ZK identity (anti-Sybil)  
- HyperBee = no centralized DB  
- Tor = anonymized routing  

---

# ✅ 8. Conclusion

RWRD is not the starting point — **contributors are**.  
They receive:

✅ App features matching their tier  
✅ Governance rights  
✅ Early reward eligibility  
✅ Recognition as early builders  

The token will be launched **later**, by a DAO vote, when the ecosystem is stable and mature.
