# LastParadox Whitepaper

## 1. Introduction
The internet has become increasingly centralized, exposing users to censorship, surveillance, and security risks.  
**LastParadox** is a decentralized VPN (dVPN) powered by **WireGuard** and **Distributed Hash Tables (DHT)**, ensuring privacy, resilience, and true peer-to-peer networking.  

Our mission is to **give back control of the internet to its users** by providing secure, censorship-resistant, and community-driven connectivity.

## 2. Problem Statement
- Traditional VPNs rely on centralized servers ‚Üí Single point of failure & risk of seizure.  
- Users lack transparency ‚Üí They must trust providers not to log or misuse their data.  
- Node operators face legal risks without proper decentralization & protection.  

---

## 3. The Solution: LastParadox
- **Decentralized architecture** using DHT to connect peers without central servers.  
- **WireGuard tunnels** for secure and fast connections.  
- **Multi-hop routing** to protect node operators from liability.  
- **Staking and rewards** system to incentivize node operators and users.
